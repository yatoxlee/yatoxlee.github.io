# A personal website
I put my experience of learning computer science here for my convience and communication.

This could be a record of my learning experience.

Since I'm making trasition from Physics to CS, a schedule is needed.

from the latest half year to the next five years.

Maybe it is a kind of way to develop logic of myself.

I think I wasted a lot of time. 

I should pick up a pure way for my postgraduate.

Either following my supervisor to be a experiment worker, either pick up the Computer Science.

I can't tell whether I belong to the CS world, but I can tell I don't belong to this Physics world.

And I realized I'm a person who should be alone and make something advanced by myself, to polish a jade until it's perfect. 

Too much listening will destory my logic, which is a cruel fact for me.
