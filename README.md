# A personal website
I put my experience of learning computer science here for my convience and communication.

This could be a record of my learning experience.

Since I'm making trasition from Physics to CS, a schedule is needed.

from the latest half year to the next five years.

Maybe it is a kind of way to develop the logic of myself.

Besides, it seems unable to find out a interdisciplinary between Physics and CS. 
So I thought maybe I should focus on CS for a period.
Then I can think about what to do with Physics with CS.

Some targets at this moment. 
Please focus on the targets concerned with CS here.
Keep away from the targets like IELTS, etc.

- [ ] finish studying learnpytorch.io in a month.
- [ ] After that, be able to read CS papers.
- [ ] raise Unimplementederror

I think I wasted a lot of time. 

I should pick up a pure way for my postgraduate.

Either following my supervisor to be a experiment worker, either pick up the Computer Science.

I can't tell whether I belong to the CS world, but I can tell I don't belong to this Physics world.

And I realized I'm a person who should be alone and make something advanced by myself, to polish a jade until it's perfect. 

Too much listening will destory my logic, which is a cruel fact for me.
