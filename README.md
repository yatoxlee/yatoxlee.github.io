# A personal website
I put my experience of learning computer science here for my convience and communication.

This could be a record of my learning experience.

在神经网络中，每个神经元接收来自上一层神经元的输入，并将这些输入进行加权求和，然后加上一个偏置项。这个结果被称为神经元的“激活前”值。激活函数的作用就是对这个“激活前”值进行非线性变换，得到神经元的最终输出。

更具体地说，激活函数是一个数学函数，它接受一个实数作为输入，并返回另一个实数作为输出。这个输出决定了神经元是否被“激活”，以及激活的强度。

以ReLU为例，如果神经元的logit是<0的，那么这个神经元就“不被激活”；反之，如果这个神经元的logit大于0，那么这个神经元就被激活，提供一个非零的值。。

Since I'm making trasition from Physics to CS, a schedule is needed.

from the latest half year to the next five years.

Maybe it is a kind of way to develop the logic of myself.

Besides, it seems unable to find out a interdisciplinary between Physics and CS. 
So I thought maybe I should focus on CS for a period.
Then I can think about what to do with Physics with CS.

Some targets at this moment. 
Please focus on the targets concerned with CS here.
Keep away from the targets like IELTS, etc.

- [ ] finish studying learnpytorch.io in a month.
- [ ] After that, be able to read CS papers.
- [ ] raise Unimplementederror

I think I wasted a lot of time. 

I should pick up a pure way for my postgraduate.

Either following my supervisor to be a experiment worker, either pick up the Computer Science.

I can't tell whether I belong to the CS world, but I can tell I don't belong to this Physics world.

And I realized I'm a person who should be alone and make something advanced by myself, to polish a jade until it's perfect. 

Too much listening will destory my logic, which is a cruel fact for me.
